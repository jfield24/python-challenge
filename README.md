# python-challenge

In this challenge, I had to create two Python scripts for analysing csv files (for PyBank and PyPoll).

For PyBank, I had to create a python script that analysed the financial records of a company.
I had to compute:
- The total number of months included in the data set
- The net total amount of profit/losses over the entire period
- The average of the change in profit/losses over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (month and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (month and amount) over the entire period
I then had to print my analysis to the terminal and export the results to a text file.

For PyPoll, I had to create a python script that analysed poll data for a small town.
I had to compute:
- The total number of votes cast
- A list of any candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate received
- The total number of votes each candidate received
- Who the winner of the election was (based on most votes)
I then had to print my analysis to the terminal and export the results to a text file.
